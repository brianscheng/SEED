# Subtidal temperatures from benthic loggers, buoys, and OISST

From 2013-2019, loggers have been deployed at Smith's Cove (SW Appledore), 
Transect 8 (NW Appledore), and Devil's Dance Floor (NE Appledore) at ~ 8m. 
Logger data were calibrated against OISST and Buoy 44030 to create predicted
temperature records. Processing code is at https://github.com/Intertidal-Subtidal-WG/subtidal_appledore_temps for reference. Files are large, so, here we've provided .RDS files which are readable in R. For lower-level products, see the processing repository.
